<p class="message">
I am Pierluca, Computer Science and Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano. I graduated in 2017 from University of Catania.  

I am currently working on generative models for computer vision and RL. I am also interested in ML-based medical imaging and bioinformatics.  

I write short songs of debatable quality, from time to time.
