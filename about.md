Hi there! I am Pierluca D'Oro.
Currently, I am currently a research intern at [NNAISENSE](www.nnaisense.com), working on reinforcement learning and computer vision.

I did my MSc at Politecnico di Milano under the supervision of Prof. Marcello Restelli, working on [going beyond maximum likelihood model estimation in model-based policy search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04115).

Previously, I worked with Prof. Concetto Spampinato at the University of Catania on [using generative models for performing self-supervised video object segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09092).
