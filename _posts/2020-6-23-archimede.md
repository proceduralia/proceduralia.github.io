I was quietly working in the office in Lugano, when I was asked a fairly simple question.
_"Where are you from?"_. Sounds easy, uh? It's less easy than it seems, when it is [Prof. JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Schmidhuber) himself asking it.
"I am from Sicily!", I proudly replied. _"Sicily? One of the greatest minds of all times was from Sicily!"_.
I wandered in my thoughts for many seconds over the dozens of great men and women that a little big island like Sicily hosted during its history.
Then, before I could say a word, I was enlighted: __"Archimedes, of course!"__.

Archimedes is an incredible example of ancient genius.
In the third century B.C.'s Syracuse, that Cicero defined as the _most beautiful Greek city of ancient times_, he gave rise to invaluable discoveries and inventions.
Some people say there are three types of scientists: _the philosopher_, that dreams and creates impactful thoughts which resonate forever; _the mathematician_, that strives for finding order in chaos by using math; _the craftsman_, that directly transforms his ideas into powerful real-world solutions.
Archimedes was all these types at the same time, demonstrating in all the different facets of a scientist genial capabilities that nobody was able to match for centuries.

He was totally immersed in his scientific work: it is known that he was sometimes even forgetting to take a bath or to eat, when he could not easily solve the problem he was facing.
Archimedes was an incredibly strong believer of the power of science.
He boldly said to his king _"Give me the place to stand, and I shall move the earth!"_, directly referencing his discovery of the physical principles behind the lever, but also implicitly stating that no obstacle was impossible to overcome by using human intelligence and rationality.

His studies in mathematics were extremely fine.
Among the other things, he proved the correct procedure for computing the area of a circle and other important formulas on spheres and cylinders.
He understood and leveraged in his reasoning the concepts of infinitely large and infinitely small, that form the basic tools of modern science as formalized by Newton and Leibniz several centuries later.
To define a measure on his incredible math skills, it has been said that comparing Archimedes' writings to the well-known Euclide's geometry works is like comparing Quantum Mechanics to high-school math.

Archimedes built wondrous machines.
His first credited invention was the _Archimedean screw_, a revolutionary pump, inspired by his travels in Egypt, able to easily move water for irrigation purposes.
He also created a number of weapons to protect his city.
For instance, the _claw of Archimedes_, a special hook able to lift and sink enemy ships; or the celebrated and controversial _heat ray_, a system of mirrors to focus sunlight on wooden ships and set them on fire.
Modern experiments confirmed the feasibility of many of his inventions, including the war machines.

A fundamental part of Archimede's legacy is composed by the legendary stories about his life.
His proverbial exclamation _"Eureka!"_ came out when he realized while taking a bath the principle named after him, which regulates how bodies immersed in fluids behave, then running naked on the streets of Syracuse full of joy for its realization.
He died by Roman hand during the siege of his hometown, in 212 B.C.: he was so focused on a mathematical proof that he refused to follow a Roman soldier before completing it. The soldier, upset, killed him.
Whether these anecdotes are actually real facts, or they simply reflect the clumsy prejudice that fellow citizens had on the most brilliant mind of ancient history, is still an open question.
