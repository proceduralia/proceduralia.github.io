Ciao! My name is Pierluca D'Oro. I am a PhD student at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by [Pierre-Luc Bacon](http://pierrelucbacon.com/) and [Marc G. Bellemare](http://www.marcgbellemare.info/).

My research area is reinforcement learning. I am particularly interested in studying how an agent can intimately exploit knowledge about its own learning process, and in the interaction between RL algorithms and neural networks training.

I did my MSc at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), working on model-based reinforcement learning under the supervision of Prof. Marcello Restelli.
Previously, I worked on generative models with Prof. Concetto Spampinato at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/), in my hometown in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily).
I have also spent some time as an intern at [NNAISENSE](https://nnaisense.com/) in Lugano, mainly working with Wojciech Ja≈õkowski on model-based reinforcement learning.
