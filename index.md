Ciao! My name is Pierluca. I am a Sicilian scientist working at Meta in San Francisco, building a new generation of AI agents.  

I obtained my PhD at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Montreal, my MSc at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) in Milan, and my BSc at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/) in my hometown in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily).
I have also spent some time as an intern at [NNAISENSE](https://nnaisense.com/) in Lugano.

During my PhD, I have worked on reinforcement learning. Among other things, I had fun finding out [new ways to change how neural nets interact with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07802), inventing [intuitive ways to scale compute for more efficient agent training](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OpC-9aBBVJe), and developing one of the first methods for [training agents using rewards obtained from an LLM's feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00166).

You can find me on X or LinkedIn.
