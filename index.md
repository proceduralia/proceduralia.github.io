Ciao! My name is Pierluca D'Oro. I am a final-year PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by [Pierre-Luc Bacon](http://pierrelucbacon.com/) and [Marc G. Bellemare](http://www.marcgbellemare.info/) and a visiting researcher at Meta.

I work on the science of AI agents. My current focus is on building aligned agents from Large Language Models.

I obtained my MSc at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) and my BSc at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/) in my hometown in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily).
I have also spent some time as an intern at [NNAISENSE](https://nnaisense.com/) in Lugano.

<b> I am on the job market right now. </b>
