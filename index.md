Ciao! My name is Pierluca D'Oro and I am constantly trying to learn how to be a better scientist. Currently, I am a research intern at [NNAISENSE](https://nnaisense.com/) in Lugano.

My research area is machine learning, especially reinforcement learning. I am particularly interested in studying how the learning process of an agent can exploit knowledge about the process itself.

I did my MSc at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), working on model-based reinforcement learning under the supervision of Prof. Marcello Restelli.
Previously, I worked on generative models with Prof. Concetto Spampinato at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/), in my hometown in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily).
