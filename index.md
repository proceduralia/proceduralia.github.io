Ciao! My name is Pierluca. I am a researcher at Meta and a PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/).

I work on the science of AI agents. My current focus is on creating systems that take advantage of Large Language Models to design AI agents.

I obtained my MSc at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) and my BSc at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/) in my hometown in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily).
I have also spent some time as an intern at [NNAISENSE](https://nnaisense.com/) in Lugano.

To get in touch, write me an email at ![mail](/assets/images/mail2.png){:class="img-responsive"}
